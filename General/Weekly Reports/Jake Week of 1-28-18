*****Jake Lewandowski Weekly Report (Week of 1/28/2018)*****
The main goal we achieved this week was learning more about the XSEDE portal and how we are going to use its supercomputing capabilities.
We read up a lot on XSEDE and Alex showed me a great video on how it works. This helped a lot in understanding how we will use it when the
time comes. For now we can start looking into the use case more and start developing the document soon.
