*****Jake Lewandowski Weekly Report (Week of 2/11/2018)*****

As of right now me and Alex have a really good understanding of the use case. We know what we need to develop and what the pipeline
needs to do. At a software engineer level, our goal is to create a pipeline where we can submit a set of images and get an image in return
with a confirmation on whether or not their is biological life present in the images. We are almost done with our UC document first draft,
it is coming along okay, it would be much better if we had access to the actual document created by the ICEBERG group. Once we get our
hands on that document we should start making a lot more progress on every aspect of the project.
