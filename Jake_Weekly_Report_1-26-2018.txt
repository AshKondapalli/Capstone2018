*****Jake Lewandowski	Weekly Report	(Week of 1/21/2018)*****

This week pretty much kicked off the project. While there is still a lot of research and learning
that needs to be done, the group has a solid fondation on the current state of the project and what
it is going to take to have a impact on the ICEBERG project. A lot of knowledge was gained from the
chat with the entire team that took place last friday. The slideshows prepared by the members of the
team were phenomenal, in my opinion. The Capstone group now has a great understanding of what the 
ICEBERG team looks to accomplish and we are ready to help their efforts. 

The largest tangible accompishments this week were the creation of the projects Github repository,
creating an account on the XSEDE User Portal, and emailing Heather Lynch regarding waivers to gain
access to the restriced images and receiving the toy images that she has for us. All of this is a
step in the right direction to actually start some hands on work. The group's main focus currently
is researching and learning more about High Performance Computing and some platforms that we could
possibly use. The group also is to begin looking into the tools we will use on XSEDE, now that we
have access to them.
