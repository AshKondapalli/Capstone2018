UC-4: Supraglacial Stream Discharge
We are creating a pipeline to delineate streams in the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) from other 
forms of water (i.e. slush, lakes). The user will log into the head node of the HPC, submit the satellite images 
to the job scheduler, and then the compute node will process the image. An updated image with the delineated streams 
will then be sent back to the user.


Actors:
User (initiating)
Head node (participator)
Compute node (participator)
Job Scheduler (participator)


Preconditions:
-High resolution satellite image of the GrIS 


Postconditions:
-Updated image with streams delineated from other forms of ice (i.e. slush, bare ice)


Flow of events
User logs into head node of HPC system
User submits the set of images (job) to the job scheduler
Scheduler sends job to compute node
Compute node delineates stream and eliminates slush
Compute node generates output file
Output file sent back to user with updated, delineated image
